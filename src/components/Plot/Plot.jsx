          Assassin's Creed is a multimedia franchise set in various historical
          eras, created by Patrice DÃ©silets and Jade Raymond, based on
          action-adventure video games with stealth components; developed and
          published by various Ubisoft studios since 2007, the titles are
          considered the spiritual successors of Prince of Persia. The main
          theme of the series is the eternal conflict between the order of the
          Assassins and that of the Templars, which develops in various
          historical periods that actually existed and were faithfully recreated
          through a superdimensional device called the Animus; an important part
          of the plot is also the discovery of an ancient terrestrial
          civilization called Isu.
